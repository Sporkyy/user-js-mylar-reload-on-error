# Mylar - Reload on Error Userscript

Sometimes Mylar throws a 500 error when loading a page

The error resolves itself if the page is reloaded

This userscript will watch for those errors and reload the page

Sometimes more than one reload is required

And the error will occur on multiple tabs

So subsequent reloads are randomly timed
